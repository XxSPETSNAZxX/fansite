            <div id="main"><p>Star Wars Battlefront 2 is a first and third person shooter. The story is about the main character Iden Versio (who is a high ranking member of the Galactic Empire) turning against the Empire and her father to join the Rebellion and fight to restore order in the galaxy. In my opinion, the story is pretty good. But multiplayer is where the fun is at! Multiplayer is based on All 3 Star Wars Eras(Prequel Trilogy, Original Trilogy, Sequel Trilogy) with battles, planets, weapons, heroes, villians, vehicles, equipment, and customization. There are 11 game modes right now in Star Wars Battlefront 2. The 11 game modes are Galactic Assault, Capital Supremacy, Blast, Strike, Arcade, Heroes And Villains, Ewok Hunt, Extraction, Starfighter Assault, Instant Action and the new gamemode CO-OP. In my opinion Star Wars Battlefront 2 is the best Star Wars game in years.</p></div>
